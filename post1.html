    	<p>The Woodwork Amsterdam site uses a variety of interesting methods, on their homepage, to create an interactive and immersive first impression. The various pictures and stills from their portfolio, laid out in a horizontal composition, automatically encourages the viewer to investigate the page. Upon investigation, it becomes apparent that the homepage automatically scrolls when the mouse hits the far left or right edge of the page. White accents displayed on the bottom portion of each picture/still flip to black upon the presence of the user's mouse. Finally, when the viewer decides to click on a picture, the section expands to reveal an inset page containing a video or another form of media related to the previous picture.</p>
