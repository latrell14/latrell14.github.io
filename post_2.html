    	<p>The Young and Norgate website uses several interesting features to captivate the user and keep their attention throughout the use of their website. The first feature, which is immediately noticeable, is the transformation of the user's mouse into either a double arrow, right-facing arrow, or left-facing arrow. The arrow distinction depends on where the mouse lies on the webpage. When one clicks on the mouse while it is right/left facing the page will transition to the next, either sliding left or right.</p>
